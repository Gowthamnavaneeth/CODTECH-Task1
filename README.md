Project Overview: Basic Calculator Program
![Task1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ef7f503-f53c-4a24-943d-1e7bd54a2f6f)

Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a basic calculator program in Python that allows users to perform arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program prompts the user to input two numbers and select an operation, then calculates and displays the result based on the chosen operation.

Key Features:
User Input:
Prompt for two numerical inputs from the user.
Allow the user to choose an arithmetic operation from a list of options.

Arithmetic Operations:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division (with handling for division by zero)

Error Handling:
Input validation for numerical values.
Handling of invalid operations.
Error message for division by zero.

Interactive User Interface:
Clear instructions and prompts for user interaction.
Display of results in a user-friendly format.
Implementation Details:

Functions:
add(x, y): Returns the sum of x and y.
subtract(x, y): Returns the difference between x and y.
multiply(x, y): Returns the product of x and y.
divide(x, y): Returns the result of dividing x by y, with special handling for division by zero.

Main Function:
Greets the user and explains the purpose of the program.
Prompts for and validates numerical input.
Displays available operations and captures the user’s choice.
Executes the selected operation and outputs the result.
Handles invalid inputs and operations with appropriate messages.

Example Workflow:
User Input:

User is prompted to enter the first and second numbers.
User is then asked to select an operation from a list.
Processing:

Based on the user’s choice, the corresponding arithmetic function is called.
The result is computed and displayed.
Error Handling:

If invalid numbers are entered or if division by zero is attempted, the program provides informative error messages.
